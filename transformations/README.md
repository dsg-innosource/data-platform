# Transformations Directory

This directory contains custom transformation layers as an alternative to traditional ELT tools like AirByte.

## Purpose

- Custom Python-based data transformations
- ETL/ELT pipeline components
- Data ingestion and processing scripts
- Integration with external data sources

## Getting Started

This directory is currently empty and ready for custom transformation code to be moved here from existing codebases.
